- create a lib to build sql from schema files
  - it is a CLI tool
  - can build the whole database sql file based on all schema files
  - builds a history folder with a snapshots of previous database version
  - builds a migration (up and down) files by extracting diffs from two database.sql files | or by extracting diffs from schema file

- think and maybe explore how to use Schemas in the app:
  - is it just a representation of database table?
  - is it ok to use it for api params validation?
  - any other usage?

- explore what is Model:
  - maybe its a representation of an Entity inside the app?
  - how it correlates with Schema?
  - any usage?
